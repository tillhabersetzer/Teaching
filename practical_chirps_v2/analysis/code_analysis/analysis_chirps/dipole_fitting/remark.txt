do_dipolefitting_prewhiten and do_dipolefitting are doing nearly the same thing except that the data is whitened explicitly in do_dipolefitting_prewhiten.
The prewhitening approach uses all sensors, the other one only megplanar for further analysis. 
In case of subject04 the results look quite similar with only minor differences. 
So it might be desirable to use the prewhitened dataset.
